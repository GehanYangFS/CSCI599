# CSCI599
objective of project
This project aims at verify the correctness and efficiency of one simple path
planning and collision avoidance algorithm. The project will try to render a
3D illumination of characters ”USC” of certain volume with a swarm of drones.
The whole project will be conducted in the simulation environment Microsoft
AirSim. Path planning and collision avoidance algorithm will be implemented to
control the trajectory of each FLS. Collision results will be recorded for analysis
and improvement.
