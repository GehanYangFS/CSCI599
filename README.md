# CSCI599 - Class Project
## Authors: Bonan Shen, Gehan Yang

This project aims to verify the correctness and efficiency of one simple path planning and collision avoidance algorithm. The project will try to render a 3D illumination of characters "USC" of a certain volume with a swarm of drones. The whole project will be conducted in the simulation environment Microsoft AirSim. Path planning and collision avoidance algorithms will be implemented to control the trajectory of each FLS. Collision results will be recorded for analysis and improvement.
